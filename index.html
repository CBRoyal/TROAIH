            <p>The Interstate Highways around America serve as the transportation backbones of the 
               U.S., offering millions of Americas the opportunity to drive on them for commutes, 
               long-distance travel, freight transport daily, etc. Interstate highways have the 
               highest speed limits in a given area, which are determined by specific states, and 
               they improve the mobility of military troops to and from airports, seaports, rail 
               terminals, and other military bases. They also connect to other roads of the 
               Strategic Highway Network, which is a system of roads identified as critical to the 
               U.S. Department of Defense. There are a couple types of Interstate Highways including
               primary, auxiliary, regional, and business interstate highways, and this webpage 
               takes you on a road trip down all of the different types of Interstate highways.</p>
            <p id="types_of_interstate_highways_list">The main types of Interstate highways are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Primary</li>
                    <li>Auxiliary</li>
                    <li>Regional</li>
                    <li>Business</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Primary Interstate Highways</h2>
            <section class="container d-flex" id="primary_interstate_highway_container">
                <img class="img-fluid" id="primary_interstate_highway_scenery" src="The Routes of America_Interstate Highways_files/I-78-US_22_EB_at_mile_marker_24.5.JPG"
                 alt="Scenery of I-78 in Pennsylvania" width="300" height="300">
                <p>Primary Interstate highways, a.k.a. main-line Interstate Highways, serve as the
                   Interstate Highway System's backbones. They're offered one-/ two-digit route numbers
                   less than 100 with east-west Interstates being assigned with even numbers 
                   and north-south Interstates being assigned odd numbers. Lower numbered 
                   east-west Interstates run in the south, lower numbered north-south Interstates run 
                   in the west, higher numbered east-west Interstates run in the north, and higher 
                   numbered north-south Interstates run in the east. There are currently 71 primary 
                   Interstate highways in the U.S. and while they're those that are fully completed, 
                   they're also those that have segments still under development.</p>
            </section>
            <h2>Auxiliary Interstate Highways</h2>
            <section class="container d-flex" id="auxilary_interstate_highway_container">
                <img class="img-fluid" id="auxiliary_interstate_highway_scenery" src="The Routes of America_Interstate Highways_files/Interstate_530,_Pulaski_County,_Arkansas.jpg"
                 alt="Scenery of I-530 in Arkansas" width="300" height="300">
                <p>Auxiliary Interstate highways are subsets of the primary Interstate highways that 
                   fall into three categories: spur routes, bypasses, and beltways. Some of these 
                   Interstates connect to their parent primary Interstate at one end, but to another 
                   route at the other end. Auxiliary Interstate highways are assigned three-digit 
                   numbers in a range from 100-999 with their parent primary Interstate highway number 
                   being included at the end. Spur routes are assigned with an odd hundreds digits, 
                   while bypasses and beltways are assigned even hundreds digits. Unlike primary 
                   Interstates, auxilary Interstates are assigned either north-south or east-west, 
                   directionsdepending on the general orientation of the highway and not the route 
                   number. Some looped auxiliary Interstates will use inner-outer directions instead of
                   compass directions to avoid ambiguity. These types of highways are repeated in 
                   different states along the mainline, but not within a state.</p>
            </section>
            <h2>Regional Interstate Highways</h2>
            <section class="container d-flex" id="regional_interstate_highway_container">
                <img class="img-fluid" id="regional_interstate_highway_scenery" src="The Routes of America_Interstate Highways_files/Scenery of H-1 in Hawaii.webp"
                 alt="Scenery of I-H1 in Hawaii" width="300" height="300">
                <p>The Interstate Highway System also extends out to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico as 
                   as they're all part of the territories of the United States. There are 3 Interstate
                   highways each in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and 4 in Alaska, each assigned a certain 
                   number and prefix before it, depending on their territory. These certain types of 
                   Interstates aren't required to meet the same standards as the mainland Interstates, 
                   as highways in Alaska and Puerto Rico are designed with geometric and construction 
                   standards adequate for current and probable future traffic demands and the need for 
                   the locals of their specific region.</p>
            </section>
            <h2>Business Interstate Highways</h2>
            <section class="container d-flex" id="business_interstate_highway_container">
                <img class="img-fluid" id="business_interstate_highway_sign" src="The Routes of America_Interstate Highways_files/Business_Loop_24.png"
                 alt="Business I-24 Loop Sign" width="300" height="300">
                <p>Some Interstate highways can also be business routes, which connect a central or 
                   commercial district of a city or town with an Interstate bypass. The main purpose of
                   these routes are to serve a certain downtown area, as they're routed along surface 
                   roads. Since business Interstates are routed along surface roads, they don't have to
                   meet the standards of other Interstate highways to qualify for an Interstate route by
                   the Interstate Highway System. Like auxiliary Interstates, these types of Interstates
                   can be repeated from state to state along their route, but only in several locations
                   within the same state. Unlike the other types of Interstate highways, they use green
                   sheilds instead of red and blue and are classified as either business loops or spurs.
                   A business loop has both of its ends connected to its parent Interstate highway, 
                   while a business spur has one end at the parent Interstate highway, and the other at
                   a specific destination, often in a city or town.</p>
